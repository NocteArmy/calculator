# S-expression Calculator

The project requires Node.js to execute the code from the command line with the 'node' batch command

Open Command Prompt and navigate to project directory

From command-line:
```
$ node ./script.js 123
123

$ node ./script.js "123"
123

$ node ./script.js "(add 12 12)"
24

$ node ./script.js "(multiply 12 12)"
144
```

$ npm test --> will run a series of built-in tests included with the script

The use of double-quotes is necessary from command-line unless using the terminal from within Visual Studio Code

The './' can be omitted and the script should still run
